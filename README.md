## This is my first attempt on making something like this, so there might be LOTS of BUGS for now, I will try to fix any problems asap!
## Many thanks to the original files and [streamerbot.com ](https://streamer.bot/) which I used.

Game adjusted to work in Streamer.bot with 2 players playing against each others. (Twitch only).

🔘 Web socket server required with default port 8080.                                      

🔘 Download the .zip file - Extract the folder anywhere in your PC - Add a browser source in OBS (check Local file box) locate and add the intex.html file, uncheck Shutdown and Refresh boxes if checked.

🔘 You must be using a Twitch Bot inside Streamer.Bot ( If you don't have one, just make an account and connect it).                                      

🔘 I'm using Twitch Whispers System to send the cards values to the players, there are limitations and your chatbot must have a verified phone number you can read more here: https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/chat/bot-whispers#notes 
  
　　*Also, users must have whispers enabled or to message the bot first in order to receive them.

🔘 It works with Currency Core extension ( https://extensions.streamer.bot/docs?topic=49 ) just enable the subAction.

🔘 Download the .txt file and copy all the text inside - Go to Streamer.Bot - Imports Tab - Add the text to the Import Field.
*I have fixed some bugs and updated some code*

🔘Commands  ◻️ !pokerstart (Starts a game for anyone to join with default bet) or add any amount after the command to set the pot.

‎-------------◻️ !pokerjoin (Join a game if available). 

-------------◻️ !pokerend (Force end a game with no winners).

-------------◻️ !poker (This is the main command to trigger actions, add the action you want to take after the command, ex: !poker check

--------------------------◻️ check (skips your turn and waits for the opponent action).

--------------------------◻️ raise (type your chosen amount of raise after, ex: !poker raise 100

--------------------------◻️ reraise (only works if opponent already raised, same as raise add the amount after, ex: !poker reraise 100

--------------------------◻️ allin (this puts all your points on the pot, if you have more than your opponent, it automatically picks their max 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　points and sets the bet to that).   
               
--------------------------◻️ call (calls any raise, reraise or allin).

--------------------------◻️ fold (give up and quit the game).        
  
🔘 The browser source has a small delay between showing the cards, a message in chat will be sent short time after the cards are shown 
　　　on the screen to compensate for the Twitch delay.
